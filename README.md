# 🚀 Secure IPC Framework - Pub/Sub System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **highly secure Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) system** as an **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework**, ensuring **tamper-proof, encrypted communication**. Unlike conventional Pub/Sub models, our framework integrates **advanced security features** to prevent unauthorized access, data interception, and message spoofing. 

**Most of the Pub/Sub concepts are already available online**, but this project takes it a step further by making **security the top priority.** 🔐

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **📂 GIT**: Used as a version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **💻 IDE**: Microsoft VS Code for code development and debugging.
- **🐧 OS**: Ubuntu _(Mac users can use LIMA emulators or a VM)._  
  - _🔹 Reason:_ Mac’s native file system and process handling differ from Linux-based environments. **Mac does not natively support some low-level IPC mechanisms like System V shared memory and message queues**. LIMA provides a lightweight way to run Linux tools natively without needing a full VM, making it ideal for Mac users working on Unix-based projects.
- **🐞 Debugging Tools**: GNU Debugger (GDB) for testing and debugging C-based implementations.

## 🌍 Real-Life Use Cases of Secure Pub/Sub Systems

The **Pub/Sub model** is a fundamental IPC concept widely used in various real-world applications, but security is often overlooked. This project **focuses on securing** these real-world implementations:

1. **💬 Messaging Systems** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, MQTT) → Secure chat apps, end-to-end encrypted notification services.
2. **🔗 Microservices Communication** → Prevents unauthorized API interactions in distributed systems.
3. **📈 Stock Market Feeds** → Ensures **trusted price feeds** in high-frequency trading.
4. **🏡 IoT Networks** → **Encrypted smart home device communication**.
5. **🎮 Gaming & 📱 Real-Time Streaming** → Protects against **DDoS attacks and message spoofing**.

## 🔒 Security Enhancements in Our Pub/Sub System

Since Pub/Sub systems deal with **real-time message distribution**, security is a **top concern**. Here’s how we mitigate threats:

- **🚫 Preventing Unauthorized Access** → **Only authenticated publishers/subscribers** can join the system.
- **✅ Data Integrity & Tamper Protection** → **HMAC & digital signatures** validate message authenticity.
- **💥 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection** → Implements **rate-limiting & anomaly detection**.
- **🔑 Encryption for Data Privacy** → Messages are **AES-encrypted** before transmission.
- **👤 Authentication & Authorization** → **Role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict message flows.

### 🛠️ How TLV Enhances Security in Our Framework?

- **🛠️ Encapsulates Message Data**: Ensures messages are **self-contained and structured**.
- **⏳ Improves Processing Speed**: Since messages are well-formed, they can be **parsed faster**.
- **🔒 Security Integration**: TLV fields can be **encrypted**, ensuring **end-to-end security** in message transmission.

- [ ] Develop Comprehensive Security Test Suite

## 🎯 Conclusion

The **Secure IPC Pub/Sub Framework** ensures **efficient, real-time, and attack-resistant communication** between processes. 🔥 With **integrated security mechanisms**, this project addresses major **security loopholes** found in conventional Pub/Sub architectures. As IPC plays a crucial role in modern applications, making it **robust and attack-resistant** is vital for maintaining **system reliability, confidentiality, and integrity**. 🛡️
